#Haar Cascade Classifier
#####This Project is an implementation of Haar like feature algorithm to train images with opencv framework
####For more info please refer to this tutorial on Haar-like feature

###Prerequisite
1. Linux OS
2. Python
3. #####Positive Images
   Images which you want to detect. Crop exactly the image portion in the pictures. Better collect more than 50 images minimum in the same size not exceeding 100x100</p></H5></li>
4. #####Negative Images
   Images that doesn't contain the image you want to detect, best collected the normal pictures of the surronding where you want to install this system. Collect more than 200 images of same size which would be more than 640x320

###Steps to be followed
1. #####Install OpenCV
